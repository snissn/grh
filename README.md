# **From RH to the Grand RH to Functoriality — with a geometric mirror on the Heisenberg host**

> **One‑paragraph hook (for an ANTer/L‑functionist).** We rebuild the explicit‑formula (EF) method around a *fixed‑heat* smoothing that lives naturally in the Maaß–Selberg spherical calculus. This lets us **realize the half‑shift as a positive operator**, put **Weil positivity on rails**, and show that a simple **parity involution $\nu$** turns EF positivity into **witnesses** and **annihilators**. On $GL_1$ this gives a clean RH ledger with band‑limited tests, a distributional symmetric EF, and a concrete positivity density. The same analytic chassis then **scales to GRH for $L(s,\pi)$** (Parts I–III), produces a **finite, reproducible certificate/verifier**, and powers a **positivity‑driven proof of Langlands functoriality** without trace‑formula comparison. In parallel, a **Heisenberg geometry** recasts the same identities as holonomy/Toeplitz statements on $S^1$, giving a second derivation and a conceptual mirror. Everything below is arranged so that RH is the accessible front door; GRH, Langlands, and Heisenberg are tightly interlocking extensions that both *justify* and *enhance* the RH sequence.

> **Orientation (start here).** Begin with the **RH kernel on $GL_1$**—the asymmetric EF from the Eisenstein phase, the band‑limited symmetric EF, and the Weil‑side positivity density. That front door fixes normalizations and makes the half‑shift/positivity machinery transparent. For **statement‑level confirmation**, see the **2025 capstone**, *The Grand Riemann Hypothesis from a Geometric Annihilation Principle*, which gives a self‑contained proof of GRH for automorphic $L$‑functions and corroborates the method in full. **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.17059104](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17059104).

## Why RH first?

Experts often meet EF arguments where the normalizations fight back, the archimedean terms won’t sit still, and positivity proofs are brittle. Our RH papers neutralize that by:

1. **Deriving the asymmetric EF automorphically** from the **Eisenstein phase** (clean origin, no folklore),
2. **Packaging the symmetric EF distributionally** on a **band‑limited** class tailored to fixed‑heat smoothing, and
3. **Exhibiting an explicit Weil‑side positive density** (“Mellin–torsion on the modulus line”) that underwrites positivity throughout.

These three pieces make RH the **best entry point**: you can audit constants, see the half‑shift at work in a tame setting, and then watch the same operators lift to GRH and Langlands.

---

## What is genuinely new (and portable)

* **Constructive, positivity‑preserving half‑shift.** Realized inside the fixed‑heat calculus as a Loewner‑monotone operator; budgets, test‑cones, and comparisons remain uniform in conductor.
* **Fixed‑heat PV↔Weil bridge.** EF pairings become a positive‑definite Weil energy on realizable inputs; any off‑line zero yields a **positive‑energy witness**.
* **Finite ledgers and certificates.** Band‑limited tests become finite ledgers; an $\varepsilon$‑net produces a **reproducible verifier** for GRH‑type statements.
* **Prime‑side positivity reserve.** A Rankin–Selberg–flavored reserve provides the prime budget that drives **functorial transfers**, avoiding orbital‑integral comparisons.

**New in the 2025 capstone (delta from Parts I–III).**
* **Holonomy–Ledger Isometry.** An isometry identifies the analytic Weil ledger with **adelic holonomy** against scale‑profiles, making annihilation intrinsic rather than ad‑hoc.
* **$\nu$‑Involution Skeleton.** The functional‑equation involution is realized as a geometric operator; its $\nu$‑odd component is annihilated, forcing the witness mechanism.
* **Ramified damping $(R^\*)$ & dictionary constants.** Uniform damping bounds and explicit dictionary constants control archimedean/ramified growth, keeping budgets conductor‑robust.
* **Loewner‑monotone functional calculus.** Operator inequalities (half‑shift, Toeplitz) are encoded in Loewner order and survive adelization.
* **PV growth & zero‑counting.** PV growth bounds close the ledger around any putative off‑line zero.

**How to sanity‑check in minutes.** (i) On $GL_1$, compute the band‑limited Toeplitz form on $S^1$; (ii) read the half‑shift inequality as a clean Loewner comparison; (iii) inspect the prime reserve on the unramified block; (iv) verify $\nu$‑odd annihilation; (v) enumerate a small finite ledger and watch the budgets close.

## The arc in one narrative (RH → GRH → Langlands; with a geometric mirror)

We begin with **RH** on $GL_1$. The EF is rebuilt from the **Eisenstein phase**, then symmetrized on a **band‑limited** class. Fixed‑heat smoothing factors out the sharp cutoffs that usually cause grief; the **half‑shift** becomes a positive operator, so **Weil positivity** is visible and stable. This is not just cleaner—it sets the exact test space we will use everywhere else.

With that spine in place, **GRH** is handled by the **$\nu$-involution**: we split tests into even/odd across the functional equation, show that the archimedean piece vanishes on the odd side, and prove:

* **Annihilation ⇔ GRH** for $L(s,\pi)$: if the odd energy is zero on a fixed‑heat window, we are on the critical line; conversely any off‑line zero creates a witness with strictly positive energy.
* An **amplifier with a strict gap** drives unconditional annihilation of the odd part; the witness mechanism makes the statement falsifiable.

We then **package the method** into a **finite certificate**: for band‑limited tests the EF reduces to finitely many prime blocks plus controlled arch/ram terms; an $\varepsilon$-net over tests yields a verifiable decision procedure.

Finally, for **Langlands**, the same positivity technology gives a **prime‑side reserve**. Together with a **two‑ray** (rank $\ge 2$) or **gap** (rank $1$) argument, this forces the existence of the **functorial transfer $\Pi$** with local compatibility—*no trace‑formula comparison*—closing the circle by linking spectral and arithmetic ledgers through positivity.

In parallel, a six‑part **Heisenberg series** furnishes a **geometric avatar**: residues become holonomy on $S^1$, Szegő kernels provide a model projector, the $\nu$-involution is realized as a simple **reflection × unitary phase** on the modulus line, and the EF ledger appears as a **Toeplitz pairing on the circle**. This mirror derivation both validates the analytic side and quietly seeds forthcoming directions we aren’t discussing here.

## Reading plan for a busy professor

1. **Start here (RH, most accessible).** Read **RH‑I → RH‑II → RH‑III** for the EF origin, the band‑limited symmetric EF, and the Weil‑positivity density. Then, for **statement‑level confirmation**, cross‑check the capstone’s statement (§13) and $\mathrm{GL}_1$ specialization (§14) in **Grand RH (2025)**. **Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17059104](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17059104).
2. **RH kernel (most accessible derivation).** **RH‑I** (asymmetric EF from Eisenstein phase) → **RH‑II** (symmetric EF on band‑limited) → **RH‑III** (Weil‑side positivity density).
3. **Analytic spine (lift to automorphic $L$).** **GRH Part I** (infrastructure & half‑shift) → **GRH Part II** (PV/Weil, witness) → **GRH Part III** (finite ledgers & certificates).
4. **Applications.** **Langlands — Functoriality via positivity**, then **Geometric Part IV**, then **Reciprocity**.
5. **Geometric mirror (optional but clarifying).** **Heisenberg I–IV** (holonomy calculus) → **V–VI** ($\nu$ as geometric operator; EF on $S^1$; higher‑rank holonomy).

# Papers — ordered for reading: **RH → GRH trilogy → Capstone (GRH, 2025) → Langlands → Heisenberg**

## Grand RH (the capstone)

### *The Grand Riemann Hypothesis from a Geometric Annihilation Principle* (2025)

**What it claims.** Presents a complete, self‑contained proof of the **Grand Riemann Hypothesis** for all automorphic $L$‑functions $L(s,\pi)$ attached to unitary cuspidal representations $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_m/K$, unifying the analytic ledger with a geometric annihilation principle. Specializing to $\mathrm{GL}_1$ recovers the classical RH.

**How it works — in one line.** Any off‑line zero forces a **positive‑energy witness** in the fixed‑heat Weil energy. The **holonomy–ledger isometry** together with the **$\nu$‑involution skeleton** imposes an annihilation budget that excludes such witnesses—closing the ledger and ruling out off‑line zeros.

**How it subsumes the trilogy.** It consolidates (i) the **half‑shift** and fixed‑heat infrastructure, (ii) the **PV/Weil pairing** and the witness mechanism, and (iii) the **finite‑ledger certificates**, now made intrinsic via geometric operators—no ad‑hoc truncations or positivity hacks.

**How to spot‑check swiftly.** Skim §13–14 for the statement and the $\mathrm{GL}_1$ specialization; then use the checklist in **What to verify first**.

**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17059104](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17059104).

## Heisenberg series (the geometric mirror that strengthens the RH→GRH arc)

> An “intriguing side‑quest” that is already useful here and quietly prepares a future direction we are not discussing yet.

### Heisenberg I — *Cauchy, Laurent, and Residues as Holonomy on a Constrained Heisenberg Slice*

**What it does.** Recasts classical complex analysis as **holonomy** on $H_1\simeq S^1\times\mathbb R$; residues are vertical holonomy; Cauchy/Laurent coefficients are Fourier–holonomy pairings.
**Why it matters.** Establishes the kernel $\alpha_H=d\theta$ and the $S^1$ host used later to encode EF.
**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17043012](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17043012).

### Heisenberg II — *Holonomy Universality Beyond the Disk*

**What it does.** Globalizes the picture via conformal pullback: **one Heisenberg slice** hosts Cauchy/residue functionals for arbitrary planar domains (Hardy/Smirnov included).
**Why it matters.** Supplies a robust geometric platform on which the EF can be carried.
**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17049478](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17049478).

### Heisenberg III — *The Heisenberg Shadow: Reframing the Foundations of Analysis*

**What it does.** Connects holonomy to Szegő kernels and semiclassics; exhibits a **host category** in which the circle is initial and rigid.
**Why it matters.** Provides the microlocal backbone for the circle ledger used in RH/GRH.
**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17049492](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17049492).

### Heisenberg IV — *Adelic Modulus, Holonomy, and the Explicit Formula*

**What it does.** Adelizes holonomy and identifies the **geometric side of EF** as total **adelic holonomy** against scale‑profiles.
**Why it matters.** Bridges the geometric calculus to automorphic EF in a way that mirrors the analytic ledger.
**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17049498](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17049498).

### Heisenberg V — *The $\nu$‑Involution as a Geometric Operator on the Adelic Heisenberg Moduli Space*

**What it does.** Realizes the FE‑involution **geometrically** as reflection × unitary phase; couples it to an **amplifier/damping** picture that **annihilates $\nu$-odd holonomy**.
**Why it matters.** Geometrizes the GRH annihilation mechanism and clarifies parity on the circle.
**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17049524](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17049524).

### Heisenberg VI — *Higher Holonomy and the Geometric Annihilation Principle for $\mathrm{GL}(m)$*

**What it does.** Lifts the circle ledger to higher rank; encodes EF as distributions $\mu_Z,\mu_{\text{arith}}$ on $S^1$; proves **Toeplitz PSD ⇔ RH** and a **higher‑rank geometric annihilation** principle.
**Why it matters.** Aligns the geometric and analytic ledgers in general, reinforcing the RH→GRH→Langlands chain.
**Zenodo:** [10.5281/zenodo.17049526](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17049526).

## How the pieces lock together (in one picture)

* **RH** delivers: a canonical EF origin (Eisenstein phase), a **band‑limited** symmetric EF, and an explicit **Weil positivity density**.
* **Grand RH (2025)** consolidates the machinery into a single, self‑contained annihilation argument: **half‑shift + fixed‑heat PV/Weil energy + $\nu$‑involution + holonomy–ledger isometry + finite‑ledger certificates** ⇒ no off‑line zeros for automorphic $L$‑functions.
* **Langlands** uses exactly those operators and budgets: a **prime‑side reserve** + **two‑ray/gap forcing** yields **functorial transfer** with **local compatibility**—no trace‑formula comparison.
* **Heisenberg** provides a second, geometric derivation: the **same EF** appears as **Toeplitz** positivity on $S^1$, with $\nu$ realized as a concrete geometric operator.
  Together, they form a single ledger—**fixed‑heat + half‑shift + $\nu$ + holonomy**—that scales from RH to functoriality.

---

## What to verify first (and why it’s quick)

1. **$GL_1$ Toeplitz test.** On $S^1$, compute the Toeplitz form against the stated density and match it to the RH symmetric EF coefficients. (Immediate sanity check of normalization/positivity.)
2. **Half‑shift inequality.** Read the Loewner‑order sandwich realizing the half‑shift in the spherical calculus; it’s a clean operator comparison.
3. **Prime reserve.** Inspect the unramified prime block positivity and its quantitative lower bound—this is the forcing engine behind functoriality.
4. **$\nu$-odd annihilation.** Check that the arch block vanishes on odd inputs and that any off‑line zero yields a positive‑energy witness.
5. **Finite ledger.** For a small band‑limit, enumerate the prime blocks and see the budgets close in the certificate scheme.

---

## Closing

This program replaces brittle truncations and ad‑hoc cancellations with a **single, positivity‑preserving calculus** that is **conductor‑uniform** and **geometrically legible**. The RH papers give you the most accessible proof‑of‑concept; the GRH trilogy shows the spine scales; the Langlands papers demonstrate reach; and the Heisenberg series provides an independent, geometric mirror. If you value EF methods that are verifiable, exportable, and built for scrutiny, this ledger is designed to meet you where you are—and to hold up when you push on it.
